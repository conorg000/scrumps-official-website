# Game Design Document

Above all the experience should be **absurd, ridiculous, irreverent**.

## Game Setting

- A scrump (cool word for a crisp) has woken up in a backyard of a house
- No clue what's going on
- Explore the areas of the house, find information
- Web-based pixel art game, mobile-friendly
- Funny themes, references, dialog, mini-interactive moments

## Mechanics

- Most items can be inspected to reveal funny dialog
- Some cutscenes and dialog will be communicated with video content (TBD later)
- Some items can be collected for later use:
  - **CDs and cassettes**: 4 around the house, each corresponds to a different song by The Scrumps (House of Peterson, HOT SHOT, She Knows, Middle of the Night)
  - **Hollandia beer cans**: found around the house
  - **Compost**: found on the balcony

## Characters

- **Scrump** - The player character, a sentient crisp
- **Mr Tibbles** - A cute white fluffy cat, first companion
- **Possum** - Lives in a tent downstairs, joins after receiving compost
- **Tiny Clown** - Building a beer pyramid, needs 5 Hollandia cans
- **Humunculous Skeleton** - Missing a foot, needs an x-ray found somewhere
- **Adele** - The inspector, antagonist who chases you
- **Mr Feng** - The landlord, appears at the end
- **Bush Turkey** - Keeps coming back to eat scrumps, final boss

## Rough Game Plot

### Act 1: Backyard Awakening
- Scrump becomes conscious in the backyard
- Inspect something to meet Mr Tibbles
- "Wow you're lucky to be alive. That bush turkey has been coming back everyday to eat you guys."
- "I guess that was a tactless way to break such sad news. Sorry."
- "Today is inspection day, Adele is here, we have to tell the subletters to hide"
- Mr Tibbles joins you on the quest (follows you around)

### Act 2: Exploring the House
- **Discover downstairs room**
  - Inspect the tent to find a visitor: a possum
  - Possum will only talk to you if you have compost for it to eat
  - Once given compost: Possum joins you on the quest too (follows you around)

- **Discover balcony**
  - Compost is here

- **Discover living room** (accessible from balcony)
  - Filled with banana paintings
  - Meet Tiny Clown - need 5 Hollandia cans to talk to him because he's building a beer pyramid

### Act 3: The Chase (TBD)
- Maybe some reference or step involving LSD, drawing on the table, making music, getting a tattoo
- Meet Humunculous Skeleton - he needs his other foot, gotta find the x-ray somewhere
- At some point Adele chases them through the house
- Mr Tibbles says "TO THE ROOF"
- Have to run and get the ladder without getting caught by Adele

### Act 4: Rooftop Escape
- **Discover rooftop**
  - Find the other subletters, like 20 people
  - Adele is coming up the ladder
  - Clown: "We gotta jump into the kiddy pool"
  - They all jump

### Act 5: The Final Battle
- **Back in the backyard**
  - Ladder falls down, Adele is stuck on roof, everyone is safe
  - Or are they? Bush Turkey wanders into the backyard
  - Turkey wants to eat Scrump, you must fight
  - Boxing fight mini game

### Ending
- Adele arrives dishevelled
- Mr Feng walks in
- Silence
- "I watched your twitch stream guys that was sick let's get f***d up"
- Chaos and partying and boxing ensues

## Locations

1. **Backyard** - Starting area, boxing ring, kiddy pool
2. **Downstairs** - Tent with possum, band equipment
3. **Balcony** - Sunset view, compost
4. **Living Room** - Banana paintings, Tiny Clown (TBD)
